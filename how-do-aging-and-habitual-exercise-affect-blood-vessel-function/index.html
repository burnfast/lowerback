<p>When you're working out, your heart rate increases and your blood vessels open up. We hypothesized that exercise habits reduce the stiffness of vessels in the ocular circulation, which generally increases with aging. Whether this balancing act is affected by the aging process has been unknown, until now. There are limited data as to the mechanisms mediating these favorable modulatory effects of habitual aerobic exercise.
