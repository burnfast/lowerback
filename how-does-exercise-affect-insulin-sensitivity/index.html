<p>We investigated the influence of a program of exercise training consisting of three weekly sessions, each 45 min long, for 12 wk, on indices of physical fitness, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity in nine adolescents with type i diabetes; During exercise, the working muscles take glucose from the blood for energy, lowering blood sugar levels and increasing insulin sensitivity. When you engage in exercises, your muscles use glucose even without insulin, which means your blood sugar levels go down automatically. Understanding your blood sugar and exercise.
