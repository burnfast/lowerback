Is It Better To Do Cardio Before or After Weight Training? From shapefit.com
If fat loss is your main focus, you can do cardio before weight training. If your goal is to get stronger and build or maintain your muscle mass, then you’ll want to avoid doing your cardio before you lift weights as it can decrease performance and increase your risk of injury. And if you just want to lose fat and don&#39;t want to get hugely muscular, don&#39;t worry, that. Cardio can be done before weights or after weights, but many people choose to do cardio after weight lifting.
