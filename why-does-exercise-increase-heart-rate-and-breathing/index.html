To help pull more oxygen into your bloodstream. During exercise, your muscles have to work harder, which increases their demand for oxygen. The breathing will increase to rid the body of carbon dioxide and to provide more oxygen, and the pulse will increase to. When you exercise and your muscles work harder, your body uses more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide.

<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll be taking more breaths. This is why your breathing and heart rates increase: This leads to increased fatigue resistance and a greater ability to exert yourself for longer periods. So your heart rate will still rise with exercise, but it won't have to rise as much. Topic 2 Exercise Physiology IB.</p>

<p>Your muscles need more oxygen than they normally use to burn these extra calories. That doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll be taking more breaths. Exercise increases the rate at which energy is needed from food, increasing the need for both food and oxygen by the body. The heart rate increases during exercise.

<p>More oxygen is needed as your body burns glucose to produce energy and that uses oxygen when performed aerobically. More oxygen is caught up in the lungs and sent to the working muscles when the breathing rate increases. Exercise can help you live a healthy life and have a controlled weight.

<p>Meanwhile, your lungs will take in more air, making breathing more difficult. Your heart begins to beat quicker to deliver oxygenated blood to them. This makes you breathe faster to keep up with the intake and removal of the gases during respiration. Your body produces more heat during exercise as well. All About Cardio Precision Nutrition.</p>

<p>More oxygen is needed as your body burns glucose to produce energy and that uses oxygen when performed aerobically. Just as exercise raises your heart rate, it also raises your breathing rate.

At the onset of exercise, the brain signals increases in heart and breathing rates in anticipation of the increased need for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange of exercise.
