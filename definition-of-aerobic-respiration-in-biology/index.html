Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration Bio Differences From biodifferences.net
Aerobic respiration respiration using oxygen to break down food molecules is called aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the process through which glucose is burned or oxidised in the presence of oxygen to produce energy (atp). The overall reaction of anaerobic respiration of a glucose molecule can be expressed as follows; A catabolic process (see catabolism) occurring in cells where complex organic molecules are broken down to release energy for other cellular processes.

<p>It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Aerobic respiration combines oxygen with glucose to generate carbon dioxide, water, and cellular energy in the form of atp. Anaerobic respiration is a form of respiration that does not require oxygen and can occur in animals, plants and other microorganisms.</p>
