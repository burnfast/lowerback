It is unlikely that this congenital finding present since early in your life is responsible for your headache. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) is defined by inadequate blood flow through the posterior circulation of the brain, supplied by the 2 vertebral arteries that merge to form the basilar artery. Blood is delivered to several structures in the brain, particularly those responsible for movement and balance, via the carotid arteries (large vessels on each. Vertebral arteries provide the blood supply to the posterior aspect of the brain, including the cerebellum.

<p>Vertebral artery occlusions fall under the umbrella of vertebrobasilar disease (vbd), otherwise known as vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi). When the blood supply to these areas is compromised, it can lead to severe disability. It is one of the most common reasons for stroke in young. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) is defined by inadequate blood flow through the posterior circulation of the brain, supplied by the 2 vertebral arteries that merge to form the basilar artery.
