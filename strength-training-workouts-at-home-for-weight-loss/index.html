Health experts recommend 150 to 300 minutes of moderate physical activity and two to three strength sessions per week. If we estimate that your metabolism would use 50 calories per day to sustain that muscle, this means you will burn 250 more calories every day (50 calories/day x 5 pounds). There will also be upper body workouts that will focus on sculpting the muscles of the arms, back, and shoulders. Continue bending your hips and knees until your thighs are parallel to the ground.
