As a result of exercise, atp stores decrease in the muscle, and stores of adp, the by product of atp increase when exercise intensity increases, there is an increase in the rate of metabolism required to produce atp in the muscles heat is a by product of the process of converting chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy (movement).

<p>Body systems work together, to make sure that you have enough energy to perform. These stages involve more complex chemical reactions than the other energy systems which is why atp production is much slower. Our bodies can create anaerobic energy in two ways through the: Assignment 1 unit 2 alex doyle enjoy :) acute exercise effects on the musculoskeletal and energy systems the oxygen breathed in is a catalyst for the chemical reaction in our muscles (including the heart).

<p>It is important to understand the changes that happen to the body as a result of physical activity. Virtually all tissues in the human body rely on aerobic metabolism for energy production and are therefore critically dependent on continuous supply of oxygen. This energy system is used during high intensity exercise. One approach for systematically developing an optimal aerobic exercise intervention for persons with tbi involves the examination of single bouts of aerobic exercise (i.e., acute aerobic exercise.
