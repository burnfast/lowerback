Lesson 2 long term effects of exercise From slideshare.net
The effect of training on endurance and the cardiovascular responses of individuals with paraplegia during dynamic exercise induced by functional electrical stimulation. Subgroups included dogs with at least one season of previous training (“veterans”) and dogs undergoing their first season of training (“rookies”). Endurance training causes an increase in a few specific hormones that regulate the amount of blood in the body. Thus, a cardiovascular fit person is expected to have an in increased cardiac output.

<p>After training, cardiac output was reduced at moderate work loads (13.1%) causing a change of the relation between oxygen uptake and cardiac output from hyperkinetic to. Active people have lower blood pressure because their cardiac muscles can better compensate the increased blood demand that. The work done by the heart and hence energy yield must then be permanent, adaptable, rapidly regulated, and highly efficient.
