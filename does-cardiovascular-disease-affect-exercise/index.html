<p>Regular exercise has a favorable effect on many of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Despite strong scientific evidence supporting the benefits of regular exercise for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (cvd), physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide. We now know that people who take up regular physical activity after an initial cardiac event (such as a heart attack ), and who have stable disease symptoms, have a 31% lower risk of experiencing another, fatal cardiac event. These studies suggest that the risk factors for cardiovascular disease in adults, which include a family history of heart disease, elevated blood lipids (serum cholesterol and triglycerides), obesity, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus and inadequate physical activity, can be identified in children.</p>
