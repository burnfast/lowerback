Circulatory Systems A Level Notes From alevelnotes.com
The circulatory system is a network of organs and vessels that is responsible for the flow of blood, nutrients, hormones, oxygen and other gases to and from cells. The pulmonary circulation is the portion of the circulatory system which carries deoxygenated blood away from the right ventricle, to the lungs, and returns oxygenated blood to. Mammalian heart is four chambered, having two auricles and two ventricles. The mammalian aorta is an unpaired structure derived from the left fourth aortic arch of the primitive vertebrate.
