<p>The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. The body has different ways of creating energy and using energy. Aerobic capacity is a way to measure how efficiently the above scenario takes place.

Aerobic capacity is defined by the american college of sports medicine (acsm) as the ability to perform dynamic exercise that involves large muscle groups at a moderate to high intensity for prolonged periods.v̇o 2max is the most widely accepted measure of such aerobic capacity. While there are a number of ways to measure aerobic capacity (more on this below), think of aerobic capacity as the volume of oxygen pumped through your body in a given amount of time. Aerobic capacity is an index of the adaptive ability of large striated muscles to work by using energy from aerobic metabolism.</p>
