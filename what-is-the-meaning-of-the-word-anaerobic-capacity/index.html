<p>This capacity is good for the endurance aspect of activities like crossfit. While this can result in feeling out of breath, the anaerobic system gets its energy from storage reserves and puts it into the muscle cells. It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. In contrast, anaerobic capacities function under conditions with little or no oxygen, such as jumping, sprinting or lifting.</p>
