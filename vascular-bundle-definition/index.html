<p>Cambium is a meristematic tissue responsible for secondary growth in plants. Vascular bundle consists of xylem and phloem. In a vascular bundle, the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves and phloem transports food from leaves to all parts of the plant. Bicollateral vascular bundle is a kind of conjoint vascular bundle in the stem that has only one strand of xylem and two strands of phloem.</p>
