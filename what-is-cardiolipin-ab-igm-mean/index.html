They are often measured to help diagnose different conditions, such as infections, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, and certain types of cancer. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection. Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding.
