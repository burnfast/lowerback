Power is important in sport because it is a reflection of the body’s energy production, applied to generate. Training to improve power can include lifting weights. Power is defined as the amount of work performed per unit of time. Muscular strength is an aspect of physical fitness that is typically gauged with the maximum amount of weight that a given muscle can move for one repetition.

<p>Power is defined as the amount of work performed per unit of time. Muscular endurance is when less force is sustained. Work is the product of a force on an object, and remember, muscular strength is the maximal amount of force muscles can exert on an object. While strength is the maximal force you can apply against a load, power is proportional to the speed at which you can apply this.</p>

<p>Muscular strength is an aspect of physical fitness that is typically gauged with the maximum amount of weight that a given muscle can move for one repetition. Power in its simplest form is the product of force multiplied by distance, divided by time. Muscle strength should not be confused with the concept of muscular power. In a sporting context, force can be substituted for strength, and time/distance indicated by the speed of movement. PE Poster Top 10 Cardiovascular Endurance Exercises Cardiovascular.</p>
