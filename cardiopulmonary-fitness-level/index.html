<p>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is an exercise test for analyzing both diagnostic and prognostic assessment by evaluating both submaximal and peak exercise response involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, neuropsychological, and skeletal muscle systems[1], cpet is aimed at the evaluation of exercise performance, functional capacity, and impairment. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. Testing for actual vo2 max is best suited for a clinical setting. It can discriminate cardiovascular, ventilatory, and musculoskeletal limitations during exercise by monitoring. How to do cardio Cardio Guide weighttraining.guide.</p>
