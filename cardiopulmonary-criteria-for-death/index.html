A determination of death shall be made using either of two criteria: The heart generates pressure that pumps blood that carries nutrients, oxygen, hormones, et cetera to cells, tissues, and organs of the body. An estimated 17.7 million people died from cardiovascular diseases in 2015, representing 31 percent of all global deaths.

<p>Some countries, such as the united states, accept the concept of brain death as “whole brain death,” which is defined as irreversible. With all the controversy surrounding neurological criteria for death, the traditional criteria related to heartbeat and breathing have remained largely unchanged and undisputed except in the university of pittsburgh medical center's program in which organs are taken from certain patients as soon as possible after expected cardiopulmonary death. The 2010 american academy of neurology guidelines for brain death determination in adults necessitate 3 clinical findings: Therefore, the minimum determination of death criteria should be rigorous, global, and acceptable for medical practice worldwide, while remaining respectful of diversities.
