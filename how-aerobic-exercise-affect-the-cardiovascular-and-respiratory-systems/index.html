The heart delivers a carefully calibrated amount of blood to the body to match o2 delivered to o2 needed. During exercise, acid is produced and body temperature increases as oxygen is removed from. aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. Effects of physical exercise on the cardiovascular system somebody with high levels of physical activity has a lower prevalence and lower mortality rates for the incidence of cardiovascular disease.
