Resistance training (rt) is effective for improving muscle fitness in older individuals as well as young healthy individuals.

While their results suggested that rt has no. Muscle fiber responses (1, 9, 14), neuromuscular adaptations (4, 6). However, less is known regarding the effects of ret on mental health outcomes. Resistance training causes minor fibre damage and results mainly in hypertrophy compared to the classical regeneration response of skeletal muscles where there is clear evidence of myofibre.

<p>Resistance training (also called strength training or weight training) is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build strength, anaerobic endurance and size of skeletal muscles. Data were retrieved from medline, embase, pubmed, cinahl and cochrane central register of controlled trials (central) databases from inception to april 2020. However, the effects of rt on autonomic nervous function (anf) in the elderly have not been fully elucidated. Youth resistance training has been shown to decrease not only the risk of injury, but also of the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
