<p>A review of the literature strongly suggests that step tests can give reliable and valid measures of cardiorespiratory fitness provided that (a) the subjects have received adequate instruction and practice in taking the test prior to the criterion test performance, and (b) the work load is above a certain threshold. Cardiorespiratory endurance is determined by the amount of oxygen taken in by the body (vo2 max) and how efficiently it is utilised during vigorous activity. You can repeat these tests down the road to help measure your progress and keep you motivated. This chapter presents the committee's review of the scientific literature that explores the relationship between specific field tests of cardiorespiratory endurance and health outcomes in youth.

<p>Some of the tests that can be used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness are the 2.4 km run test, the astrand treadmill test and the multistage bleep test. A lower resting hr generally indicates better cardiovascular fitness. Currently, the recommended method is a graded exercise test (gxt) on an ergometer such as a treadmill or cycle, which may not always be possible. Your doctor can measure cardiorespiratory fitness through what's called your maximal oxygen consumption (vo2 max) or from readings taken while you do an aerobic workout.
