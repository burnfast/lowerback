<p>The definition of muscular endurance is a muscle or group of muscles’ ability to repeatedly produce force, with the key term here being repeatedly. As its name may suggest, aerobic endurance is built by engaging in cardiovascular, or aerobic, exercise. Endurance training is largely influenced by physiological factors (efficiency of energy systems, aerobic capacity/vo2 max, lactate threshold, muscle strength, power and muscular endurance). Think wrestlers, boxers, baseball players, tennis, football. Types of exercises you can try IB Personal project.</p>

<p>Muscular endurance training is highly emphasized in athletes training regimens. Long, slow distance (lsd) the intensity of lsd is equivalent to 70% vo2 max (≅80% hrmax) for a duration of &gt;60 minutes, making it a relatively low intensity activity with a high volume of training. The definition of muscular endurance is a muscle or group of muscles’ ability to repeatedly produce force, with the key term here being repeatedly. Training at this intensity trains your cardiac output and heart muscle, strengthens your immune system, and reduces cholesterol level and blood pressure.
