<p>Aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen,  and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. Aerobic exercise increases the body’s capacity to absorb, deliver, and utilize oxygen. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Active exercise motion imparted to a part by voluntary contraction and relaxation of its controlling muscles. IGCSE Biology Notes 2.48 Describe Experiments to Investigate the.</p>

<p>Aerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen, while anaerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration that takes place in the absence of oxygen. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Aerobic exercise not only enhances cardiorespiratory fitness, but is also beneficial for symptoms like fatigue, impaired cognition and mood disturbances. Decreases risk of heart disease.

<p>Aerobic exercise is sometimes known as “cardio” — exercise that requires pumping of oxygenated blood by the heart to deliver oxygen to working muscles. This means you’ll be able to work harder and longer as your aerobic capacity increases. By definition, aerobic exercise income “with oxygen.”.

Aerobic exercise is indicated for patients who lack the ability to sustain activity for a desired period of time because of decreased cardiovascular efficiency. However, it noted that resistance training is important. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food.</p>
