<p>According to the american lung association, when you exercise, your heart and lungs work harder to supply the additional oxygen your muscles demand. It is your heart’s job to pump that round your body so that the fuel gets to your muscles. Not only does the heart work harder, but so to do the lungs. Exercise also signals the release of nitric oxide by the cells lining the insides of the blood vessels (endothelial cells). What are the best types of aerobic exercises? Quora.</p>

<p>Aerobic exercise uses oxygen, and in addition to exercising the heart and lungs it burns fat, wards off disease and improves mood. Exercising muscles need more blood. Aerobic activities like walking, running or jumping rope give your heart and lungs the kind of workout they need to function efficiently. As a result, your breathing rate increases to bring in more oxygen and your heart rate increases to pump the oxygenated blood throughout your body. Aerobic Exercise Strengthens The Heart Body And Lungs Aerobic.</p>

<p>Your brain senses the low oxygen levels and stimulates your body to respond very quickly by making you breathe more rapidly and more deeply. Total lung capacity is the amount of air in the lungs after a maximal inspiration. These cardiovascular benefits help manage cholesterol; In turn, muscle cells boost levels of the enzymes that allow them to use oxygen to generate energy.

<p>Your brain senses the low oxygen levels and stimulates your body to respond very quickly by making you breathe more rapidly and more deeply. The increase in muscle wall thickness also increases the contractility resulting in a higher stroke volume at rest and during exercise, increasing blood supply to the body. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. Exercise leaves an effect on your diaphragm and intercostals muscles, and regular exercise will help strengthen the respiratory muscles. Facts About Aerobic Exercise And What It Entails.</p>

<p>The strength of your inspiratory muscles and the physical properties of the lungs and chest wall determine your total lung capacity. Exercise, especially aerobic exercise, increases the efficiency of this process and may increase your lung capacity. Aerobic activity makes your heart beat faster than usual. Some examples of moderate activity include walking briskly, recreational bicycling, gardening and vigorous housecleaning. Cardio The heart of Fitness is where Rebounding really shines..</p>
