<p>Antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. Autoimmune antibodies can be formed against natural (normal) cell surface proteins.when this happens, adverse effects can occur. The only test that came back elevated was cardiolipin antibody, igm.
