The dependent variable is the result of that change. With exercise, the pulse rate of an individual increases because one’s body requires more oxygen to facilitate the movements.

<p>Determine the heart's recovery time; This experiment tested how exercise affects heart rate. The breathing rate and heart rates may be higher for males since they tend to have a bigger body structure and require more energy. The aha recommends a person gets at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise—exercise that elevates their heart rate to the target heart rate zone—on most days of the week, or a total.</p>
