<p>The failure can occur at many points in the body. The effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity may vary from the following: Low insulin sensitivity is also called insulin resistance. The effect physical activity has on your blood sugar will vary depending on how long you are active and many other factors. Understanding Insulin Resistance is the First Step to Reversing.</p>

<p>We investigated the influence of a program of exercise training consisting of three weekly sessions, each 45 min long, for 12 wk, on indices of physical fitness, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity in nine adolescents with type i diabetes; During exercise, the working muscles take glucose from the blood for energy, lowering blood sugar levels and increasing insulin sensitivity. When you engage in exercises, your muscles use glucose even without insulin, which means your blood sugar levels go down automatically. Understanding your blood sugar and exercise.

<p>Then the researchers measured the insulin. In addition, increases in muscle strength, size, and rate of torque development at 50ms and 100ms but not 200ms and 300ms were also observed. Low insulin sensitivity is also called insulin resistance. This effect is attributed mainly to enhanced skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity, and does not persist for more than four to five days.
