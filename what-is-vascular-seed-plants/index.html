Vascular Plants Ferns and Relatives Biology Online Tutorial From biologyonline.com
Vascular plants with naked seeds (gymnosperms) are placed in five or more phyla (divisions): In a few cases, the leaves and roots arise from underground stems, called rhizomes , which also store food. The stem of the plant is behind the derivation of the roots which are the group of simple tissues. Seed vascular plants share the characteristic of having a vascular system of internal tubes that.
