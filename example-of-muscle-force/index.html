It is smaller when it is shorter than when it is stretched. Shortening the muscle isn’t the only way your muscles can generate force. Fibres are in a state of tetanus or if more motor units are also stimulated to the point of tetanus the greater the force produced. The force couple surrounding the knee, for example, would be the quads and the hamstrings!

<p>Muscular power is the power applied utilizing portions of the body like arms or legs. Compare with oil and watet, oil is a denser medium or watet is a denser medium?why? The first way we can produce more force is by increasing muscle mass, also known as hypertrophy.contrary to what some would think, your muscles don’t become bigger by increasing the number of muscles fibres you have (termed hyperplasia), but instead by increasing the size of the muscle fibres you already. The muscular force acting on the scale is the external force. How the body absorbs force HSC PDHPE.</p>
