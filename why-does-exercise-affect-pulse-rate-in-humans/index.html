<p>Increasing the heart rate, and. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. This process is measured by a term called “cardiac output,” which determines the amount of blood pumped by the heart in a given minute. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. How can the heart increase cardiac output? Socratic.</p>

<p>Your heart begins to beat quicker to deliver oxygenated blood to them. The human body must pump blood throughout itself to provide oxygen and nutrients for the brain and other components for the human body to function properly. When animals exercise they have an increased requirement for oxygen and respiratory substrate delivery to the muscles and carbon dioxide delivery to the lungs, due to rising rates of respiration in the muscle cells to provide the atp needed for muscular contraction.

<p>The next question is, where do the oxygen that the muscle need comes from? A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles.
