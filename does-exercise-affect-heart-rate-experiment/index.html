<p>How does exercise affect heart rate. It is obvious that the breathing rate is directly proportional to heart rate and both should amalgamate during exercise to prevent illness (haldane, 2013). The american heart association (aha) recommends doing exercise that increases a person's heart rate to between 50 to 85 percent of their maximum heart rate. We did this by doing a series of activities that affected heart rate, including sitting, standing, walking, jogging, and running.

<p>The hypothesis is if you test people who do high intensity cardiovascular exercise and those who do not exercise, then the people who do high intensity exercise will have a lower heart rate because their heart is more efficient. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of exercise training on heart rate and measures of heart rate variability associated with vagal cardiac modulation and to quantify the relationship between changes in these measures. Chronic exercise training produces a resting bradycardia that is thought to be due partly to enhanced vagal modulation. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. Design an Experiment to show how exercise can affect Heart Rate in.</p>

<p>Thats likely because exercise strengthens the heart muscle. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. Here they are using a measurement to see what the effect of exercise has on the heart rate. In this experiment, cardiovascular fitness will be determined by using an arbitrary rating system to âscoreâ fitness during a variety of situations. Official heart rate lab report.</p>
