In addition, it increases your overall aerobic fitness, as measured by a treadmill test, for example, and it helps. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. Your muscles are working harder during exercise and that means their demand for oxygen.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-take-in-one-long-slow-deep">You Can Take In One Long, Slow, Deep.</h3><p>All humans have their individualized. Some of them are lower resting heart rate, ability to perform deep breaths, increased calories burn, and reduced heart disease risk. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact. As you exercise more strenuously, the sympathetic system “kicks in” to accelerate your heart rate even more.</p>
