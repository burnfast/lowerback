<p>However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp.

<p>As its name suggested, aerobic respiration is cells breaking down sugar into energy and other waste with the presence of oxygen, or also known as what you are usually referring to when talking about cellular respiration. Two types of cellular respiration exist: Cellular respiration is of two types, i.e. It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp.

<p>An aerobic process is one that requires oxygen. As already stated, cellular respiration can be of two types: The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the body cells, including inhalation and exhalation , diffusion of oxygen from the pulmonary alveoli to the blood and of carbon dioxide from the blood to the alveoli, followed by the transport of oxygen to and carbon dioxide from the.

<p>Aerobic respiration is a slow and steady process that takes place over a long period of time. In this process, a food molecule breaks down. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. Simply put, aerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration that uses oxygen, while anaerobic respiration does not. Aerobic Respiration Carlson Stock Art.</p>

<p>It is a process when glucose is broken down in the absence of oxygen. 'aero' means air, which contains oxygen, leading to the name aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct.
