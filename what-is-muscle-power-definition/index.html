Strength and speed, so can see that there is a strength aspect to power, however, it’s also about speed of muscle contraction. Muscular strength is distinct from muscular endurance (the ability to produce and sustain muscle force over a certain period of time) and muscular power (the ability to produce a given amount of force quickly) Muscular strength is the ability to exert maximal force in one single contraction, such as lifting a weight that you could lift only once before needing a short break. Define strength, power &amp; muscular endurance.

<p>Power can be defined as force × distance/time or force × velocity ().force (i.e., strength) plays a key role in power production and if not maintained with training can result in a decrease or no change in power production. These types of contractions are often called ‘explosive’. The ability to exert a maximal force in as short a time as possible, as in accelerating, jumping and throwing implements.
