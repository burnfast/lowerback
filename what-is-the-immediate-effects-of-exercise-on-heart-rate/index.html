<p>This is fairly obvious for most students in my age group, but the next question asks them to determine the recovery time and compare how recovery times differ for individuals. Students work in groups to develop a hypothesis about how exercise affects the heart rate. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit. Therefore, their heart needs less beats to pump the oxygenated blood to the muscles in need of it. Heart rate recorded during the ârestâ and âexerciseâ sessions as a.</p>

<p>5 rows immediate effects of exercise on the body systems are shown in the table: A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare recovery of autonomic cardiac regulation over three days following a single session of high intensity interval training compared to endurance training.

<p>With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate. Effective exercise occurs when the lungs, heart and muscles work harder together. Therefore, the heart muscle can pump more volume of blood per beat than a normal person. Whilst doing exercise there is an increase in respiration, this means that the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood will also increase as the oxygen is used up.
