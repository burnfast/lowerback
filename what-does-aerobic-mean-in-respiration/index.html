Aerobic respiration is the type of respiration that does not require the presence of oxygen to provide energy. If the aerobic respiration rate within a biofilm is greater than the inward oxygen diffusion rate, the metal/biofilm interface can become anaerobic and provide a niche for sulphide production by srb.</p>
