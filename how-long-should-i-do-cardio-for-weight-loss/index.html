Should You Do Cardio Before or After Weights? 1AND1 Life 1AND1 Life From 1and1life.com
Weight loss happens when you use up more calories than you consume. Cardiovascular exercise is great for weight loss, but that&#39;s not the only benefit you&#39;ll get from doing 30 minutes of cardio five days a week. Running burns about 100 calories per mile, walking burns half that. If fat loss is your main focus, you can do cardio before weight training.
