Plants belonging to the angiosperm group are vascular plants whose reproductive system is protected. Vascular plants possess a chemical known as lignin, which is a complex polymer of phenolic compounds.lignin is incorporated into an additional cell wall layer, known as the secondary (2 °) wall (figure 4.3), which is found in certain, specialized cells of vascular plants.secondary walls are secreted to the outside of the plasma membrane (between the plasma membrane and the. Vascular plants are the plants that bear a vascular system containing the xylem and phloem. (a tissue is a group of cells working together to carry out a specialized function.) the tissues are organized into specialized organs called roots, stems, and leaves.
