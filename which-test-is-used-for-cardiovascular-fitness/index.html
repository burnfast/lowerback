There are a few simple tests for basic aerobic fitness like the rockport walk test: The assessment of the anaerobic threshold is often performed by measuring lactate in the blood and is usually around 4 mmol./l, also known as obla (beginning of lactate accumulation in the blood). Cardiorespiratory endurance has been recognized as a key component of physical fitness throughout the history of the field.

<p>There are many tests that can be done to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness (the efficiency of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during exercise). Submaximal exercise tests are used to measure your cardiorespiratory endurance. One way to test is using the rockport fitness test. The test is commonly used for people recovering from a heart attack to determine how much exercise they can safely perform.</p>

<p>For best results this test is conducted in a sports science lab setting. Vo2 assessments (treadmill assessments, cycle ergometer assessments, field tests, etc.) and ventilatory threshold assessments. The assessment of the anaerobic threshold is often performed by measuring lactate in the blood and is usually around 4 mmol./l, also known as obla (beginning of lactate accumulation in the blood).
