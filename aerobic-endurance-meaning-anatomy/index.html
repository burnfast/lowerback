<p>Aerobic endurance is the amount of time an athlete can spend training at a specific intensity. During anaerobic work, involving maximum effort, the body is putting forth so much effort that the demands for oxygen and fuel exceed the rate of supply; Aerobic capacity refers to your body’s ability to efficiently use oxygen. Aerobic exercise is performed at a slower and lower intensity, meaning that you have time to breathe and use that oxygen for energy production.
