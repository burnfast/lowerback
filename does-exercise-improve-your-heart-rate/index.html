When You Exercise What Happens To Your Heart Rate ExerciseWalls From exercisewalls.blogspot.com
When you exercise, your muscles require more oxygen than when you’re at rest. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. In addition to that, if you are exercising on a hot day, then too, the high temperature coupled with the vigorous activity performed by your heart will result in an abnormal increase in your heart rate. With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate.
