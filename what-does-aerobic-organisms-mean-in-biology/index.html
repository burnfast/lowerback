<p>Aerobic bacteria types • obligate aerobes require o2 for cellular respiration to oxidise substrates—e.g., sugars and fats to obtain energy. However, an aerobic environment may allow the growth of aerobic microorganisms, whose metabolic activities can influence the corrosion of metal. The anaerobic bacteria definition does not require oxygen for its survival. The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration.
